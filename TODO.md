# TODO

This file contains a list of suggestions for improving the project.

## Dependencies

- [ ] Audit and update outdated dependencies to their latest versions to ensure compatibility and security.

## Security

- [ ] Create a `.env.example` file to provide a template for environment variables, ensuring that sensitive information is not committed to version control.

## Code Quality

- [ ] Implement a code formatter like Prettier to maintain a consistent code style across the entire codebase.
- [ ] Configure Husky and lint-staged to automatically lint and format code before each commit, improving code quality and reducing the likelihood of errors.

## Testing

- [ ] Introduce a testing framework, such as Jest or Playwright, to enable unit and end-to-end testing of the application.

## Documentation

- [x] Enhance the `README.md` file with detailed instructions on setting up and running the project locally, as well as a comprehensive overview of the project's features and architecture.
